	<strong>Brief Information</strong>
	In this research project, we aim to design and implement an effective robotic system that can infer others' goals from their incomplete action executions, and that can help others achieving these goals. Our approach is inspired from helping behaviour observed in infants; exploits robot's own sensorimotor control and affordance detection mechanisms in understanding demonstrators' actions and goals; and has similarities with human brain processing related to control and understanding of motor programs.
