	<strong>Brief Information</strong>
	The aim of this project is to implement a GUI to control Baxter robot. Through its user interface, we expect to move joints seperately, move the hand to a specific position, open and close the grippers, and display the sensors such as force/torque sensor, camera and depth data.
