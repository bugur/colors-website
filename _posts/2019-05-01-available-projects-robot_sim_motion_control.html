	<strong>Brief Information</strong>
	Operating a real robot can be cumbersome, risky and slow. Therefore, it is often helpful to be able to simulate the robot. Moreover, if a robot needs to move its hand into a desired target, it should not simply follow any path from its current position because it may hit an obstacle. Therefore, the robot needs to plan a path from its current pose to the target pose. The objective of this project is to create a realistic kinematic, volumetric and dynamic model of the Sawyer robot platform, to adapt a number of motion planning packages for Sawyer, and finally implement a benchmark task such as a pick-and-place operation across an obstacle.
