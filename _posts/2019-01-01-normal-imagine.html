	<br>
	<strong>Duration</strong>: 01.2017 - 12.2020
	<br>
	<strong>Funded by</strong>: European Union, H2020-ICT
	<br>
	<strong>Budget:</strong> ~365K Euro

	<strong>Brief Information</strong>
	Today's robots are good at executing programmed motions, but they do not understand their actions in the sense that they could automatically generalize them to novel situations or recover from failures. IMAGINE seeks to enable robots to understand the structure of their environment and how it is affected by its actions. The core functional element is a generative model based on an association engine and a physics simulator. “Understanding” is given by the robot's ability to predict the effects of its actions, before and during their execution. This scientific objective is pursued in the context of recycling of electromechanical appliances. Current recycling practices do not automate disassembly, which exposes humans to hazardous materials, encourages illegal disposal, and creates significant threats to environment and health, often in third countries. IMAGINE will develop a TRL-5 prototype that can autonomously disassemble prototypical classes of devices, generate and execute disassembly actions for unseen instances of similar devices, and recover from certain failures.
