	<strong>Brief Information</strong>
	In this project, we implemented a system that enables seeing from NAO's eyes and moving with NAO's body. NAO's motions are copied through utilizing an adapted whole-body tracking system, and the robot camera images are displayed on a head-mount display system. This system enables full embodiment, and is used for a very fruitful research direction: Utilizing robot avatars to understand the underlying mechanisms of human sensorimotor processes through changing different aspects of the embodiment.
